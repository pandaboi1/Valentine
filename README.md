# Valentine's
Cloned a repository (https://github.com/elifgazioglu/doyouwannagooutwithme.git) and added what I wanted to fit my conditions. 
I wanted to ask someone it be my Valentine's and used the cloned repository as a foundation that I can further build upon.
### This helped me build my understanding on the fundementals of HTML, CSS, and databases.
- Use of scripts to randomly move buttin within html, but would be rather to use java scrips to animate the motions and potentially turning it into a fun game.
- Designing with CSS to fit my prefered colors and styles.
- Setting up a data base to house my version of the website using Render as the backbone database.
